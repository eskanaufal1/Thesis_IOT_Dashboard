## Recommendations

1. **Use the current implementation** - It closely matches the reference
2. **For custom images** - Use Figma or Adobe Illustrator to create exact replicas
3. **For stock images** - Search using the terms above
4. **For animations** - The current CSS animations provide good visual appeal

The current implementation provides a modern, professional look that matches the reference image while being fully responsive and animated.

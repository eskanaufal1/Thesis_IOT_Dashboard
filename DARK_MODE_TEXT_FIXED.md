# Dark Mode Text Visibility Fix - Device Forms

## ✅ **Issue Resolution**

Fixed the text visibility issue in dark mode for device forms (Add Device and Edit Device modals).

### **Problem**
- In dark mode, text in form fields was not visible or hard to read
- Select dropdown options had no text color in dark mode
- Input fields lacked proper text color contrast
- Modal titles were not properly styled for dark mode

### **Solution**

#### **1. Fixed Input Component (`components/ui/input.tsx`)**
- Added explicit text color for light and dark modes
- **Before**: Missing text color caused invisible text in dark mode
- **After**: `text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-50` ensures proper contrast

```tsx
// Before
"flex h-10 w-full rounded-md border border-slate-200 bg-white px-3 py-2 text-sm ring-offset-white ..."

// After  
"flex h-10 w-full rounded-md border border-slate-200 bg-white px-3 py-2 text-sm text-slate-900 ring-offset-white ... dark:text-slate-50 ..."
```

#### **2. Fixed Select Dropdowns (`pages/DevicePage.tsx`)**
- Added text color to all select elements
- Added background and text color to option elements
- Applied to both Add Device and Edit Device modals

**Fixed Elements:**
- Status dropdown (Online/Offline)
- Relay 1-4 dropdowns (On/Off)

```tsx
// Before
<option value="Online">Online</option>

// After
<option value="Online" className="text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-50 bg-white dark:bg-slate-950">Online</option>
```

#### **3. Fixed Dialog Titles (`components/ui/dialog.tsx`)**
- Added text color to modal titles
- Ensures modal headers are visible in dark mode

```tsx
// Before
"text-lg font-semibold leading-none tracking-tight"

// After
"text-lg font-semibold leading-none tracking-tight text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-50"
```

## 🎨 **Color Scheme Applied**

### **Light Mode**
- Text: `text-slate-900` (Dark gray)
- Background: `bg-white` (White)
- Borders: `border-slate-200` (Light gray)

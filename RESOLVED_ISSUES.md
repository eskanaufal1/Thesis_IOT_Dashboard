# Resolved Issues Summary

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. **passlib/bcrypt Version Compatibility Warning**
**Issue**: The backend was showing a warning about bcrypt version compatibility:
```
UserWarning: You are using an 'bcrypt' library which is not supported by passlib
```

**Resolution**: 
- Updated `pyproject.toml` to use `passlib[bcrypt]>=1.7.4` instead of separate `passlib` and `bcrypt` dependencies
- Added version constraint `bcrypt>=4.0.0,<5.0.0` for better compatibility
- Ran `uv sync --reinstall` to ensure proper dependency resolution
- Verified the fix by testing passlib/bcrypt import and server startup

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - No more warnings, backend runs cleanly

### 2. **Password Visibility Icon Centering**
**Issue**: The eye icon (password visibility toggle) was not properly centered in password input fields.

**Resolution**: 
- Updated CSS in `LoginPage.tsx` to properly center the eye icon
- Applied consistent styling to both password and confirm password fields
- Ensured the icon is vertically centered within the input field

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Eye icon is now properly centered

### 3. **Backend/Frontend Authentication Integration**
**Issue**: Frontend authentication was using mock data instead of connecting to the backend.

**Resolution**: 
- Created complete backend authentication system with JWT tokens
- Implemented proper user model, auth schemas, and auth service
- Added FastAPI routes for login, register, profile, and password change
- Updated frontend AuthContext to use backend API endpoints
- Integrated real user management with the database

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Full authentication system working

### 4. **Performance Optimization**
**Issue**: Application had performance issues with unnecessary re-renders and large bundle size.

**Resolution**: 
- Implemented code splitting and lazy loading for all main routes
- Added React.memo for expensive components
- Optimized Chart.js components with proper memoization
- Added loading skeletons and error boundaries
- Reduced main bundle size significantly

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Application loads faster and performs better

### 5. **UI/UX Improvements**
**Issue**: Various UI/UX issues including dark mode support, toast notifications, and loading states.

**Resolution**: 
- Added comprehensive dark mode support throughout the application
- Implemented toast notification system for user feedback
- Added loading states and error handling
- Improved responsive design and accessibility
- Enhanced user dropdown menu with proper navigation

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Smooth user experience with modern UI

## 🔧 Development Commands

### Frontend (client/)
```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run preview  # Preview production build
npm run lint     # Run linting
```

### Backend (server/)
```bash
